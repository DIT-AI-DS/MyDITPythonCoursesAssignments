# INTRODUCTION

The development of computer programs is at the heart of the Internet revolution which has been invading our lives for several decades now. Writing lines of code to make a computer program work is an indispensable pillar of the modern world.

The "nocode" movement that has been raging for a few years is also based on computer programs which themselves are composed of lines of code, undoubtedly a little more complex.

The homo numericus, however, only reproduces a pattern that has existed for thousands of years: to provide a solution to a given problem.

The wheel was once invented to facilitate transportation on land. Today, we create applications that allow us in the same way to increase productivity, reduce repetitive tasks that can be automated or even create new interactions between people.

Faced with a problem, there are often a multitude of solutions. It is up to us to choose with our experience, our knowledge, those which seem to correspond best.

In terms of application architecture, this is where design patterns come into play and allow us, with already proven methods and tools, to address the design issues of an application.
## WE CAN CLASSIFY THE DESIGN PATTERNS IN 3 MAIN CATEGORIES
1. Creational patterns 
1. Structural patterns 
1. Behavioral patterns
# WHAT DESIGN PATTERNS ARE ALL ABOUT?
We all talk about the way we do things in our day-to-day activities, hobbies, and home life, and recognize repeating patterns all the time: Pasta Bolognese is exactly like plain paws but with added tomato sauce.

My neighbor's bike is like mine with red gents instead of blue.

We see the same thing in programming, when we tell a colleague how we accomplished a tricky bit of programming so that they don’t have to recreate it from scratch. We simply recognize effective ways for objects to communicate while maintaining their own separate existences.

So, we can conclude that a faire definition of design patterns is:

Design patterns are frequently used algorithms that describe convenient ways for classes to communicate.
## CREATIONAL PATTERNS 
These patterns create objects for the programmer instead of having him instantiates objects directly. This gives his program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.
## STRUCTURAL PATTERNS 
These patterns help the programmer compose groups of objects into larger structures, such as complex user interfaces or accounting data.
## BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS 
These patterns help the programmer defines the communication between objects in its system and control the flow in a complex program.
## THE STRUCTURE OF A DESIGN PATTERN?
Design pattern documentation is extremely organized. The patterns are documented from a template that classifies the information needed to understand the software problematic and the solution in terms of the relationships between the classes and objects needed to implement the solution. 

There is no uniform agreement within the design pattern community on how to describe a pattern template. 

Different authors prefer different styles for their pattern templates. Some authors prefer to be more expressive and less structured, while others prefer their pattern templates to be more precise and high grain in structure.

This is the template first described by the authors of *Design Patterns* which may be considered as a benchmark.

|**Term**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|**Pattern Name**|Describes the essence of the pattern in a short, but expressive, name|
|**Intent**|Describes what the pattern does|
|**Also Known As**|List any synonyms for the pattern|
|**Motivation**|Provides an example of a problem and how the pattern solves that problem|
|**Applicability**|Lists the situations where the pattern is applicable|
|**Structure**|Set of diagrams of the classes and objects that depict the pattern|
|**Participants**|Describes the classes and objects that participate in the design pattern and their responsibilities|
|**Collaborations**|Describes how the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities|
|**Consequences**|Describes the forces that exist with the pattern and the benefits, trade-offs, and the variable that is isolated by the pattern|

# WHY DESIGN PATTERNS ARE USEFUL FOR DEVELOPPERS?
One of the most reasons computer science analysts started to recognize design patterns is to fulfill this require for rich but straightforward reusable solutions. The term design patterns sounds a bit formal to the uninitiated and can be to some degree off-putting once you start to experiment it. But, in fact, design patterns are a helpful way of reusing object-oriented code between software projects and software engineers. 

The purpose behind design patterns is simple: to write down and catalog common interactions between objects that programmers have frequently found useful. This is what don’t reinvent the wheel is all about.

The usefulness of using a design pattern is obvious. 
## THE SPEED
The design pattern notably speeds up the development process. It provides proven development paradigms, which helps save time without having to reinvent models every time a problem arises.

As the design pattern is created with the aim of addressing known issues, these can be predicted before they even become visible during the implementation process. Again, the design pattern speeds up the development process. The standardization linked to the design pattern is also very useful to facilitate the readability of the code.

## REDUCE COGNITIVE LOAD WHILE CODING
For the most part, the causes of cognitive stack can be followed back to three primary factors:

1. too many choices
1. too much thought required
1. lack of clarity

Each of these issues will necessitate processing (time) and take up cerebral resources that don’t actually help the programmers understand the content.
## SPEND LESS TIME DEBUGGING
A programmer spends 60% up to 80% of its project debugging. So, this means that if a programmer may reduce those 60-80% he may impact the whole delivery time of a project. Which means more software to be able to deliver with the same amount of time. To get to this point of productivity, the programmer needs to focus its efforts on reducing time spent debugging.

Design patterns will introduce fewer bugs upfront with the fantastic result of drastically reduce the 60-80%. 
## TO SUM UP
The design pattern is useful when moving from an analysis model to a development model. 

Thanks to the design pattern, it is possible to document the solutions to be adopted based on past practices and the lessons learned from them. 

Several components of software are leveraged in the implementation of the design pattern. The model therefore makes it possible to accelerate a process that involves several elements. Developers use the language they master in the application of each solution.
